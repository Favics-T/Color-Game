The Game:
You'll build a simple color guessing game. A box shows a random color, and there are 6 buttons with different colors. The goal is to guess which button matches the color shown in the box.
How It Works:
Target Color Box: This box displays a random color.
Color Buttons: There are 6 buttons, each showing a different color. One of these is the correct match to the target color.
Guessing: When you click a button, the game tells you if you guessed right or wrong.
Score: Each correct guess increases your score.
New Game: There's a button to start a new game by resetting everything.
Other Details:
Instructions: The game also displays simple instructions on what you need to do.
Design: Make sure the game looks good on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) and includes some cool animations (like fading effects).
